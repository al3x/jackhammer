h2. About

Jackhammer is a generic load testing framework, written in Scala. Without assuming what sort of system you're trying to load test, Jackhammer provides flexible higher-order functions to measurably, repeatedly, and concurrently execute operations. Scripts are provided to tally statistics gathered in test runs and produce basic reports.

You might use Jackhammer to load test a new system you're building (ex: a domain-specific custom datastore), or you might use it to load test a commercial or open source system (ex: a web server, a database, a distributed cache) to ensure it meets your operational requirements.

Jackhammer was developed by members of the Infrastructure team at "Twitter, Inc.":http://twitter.com/jobs after writing several one-off load tests for both internally-developed and third-party components. It's named in honor of Twitter's primary creator, "Jack Dorsey":http://twitter.com/jack.
